# The Vision of Lightning Creations

## Scope

The vision of LC encompasses the mission, ideals, and future plan of LC.

## Vision Statement

The mission of LC is to promote STEAM education, critical thinking, and a more
open world. We hold the ideals of self-expression, community, diversity, and
reasoning in high regard; we extrapolate from that the ideal that people should
be willing to ask for help and to help others, and we extrapolate that trying
new things is a net positive and should be encouraged. LC's goal should be to
become a self-sustaining organization, revered by the community (or at the very
least respected), and in doing so create ethical jobs and create a welcoming
public presence.
